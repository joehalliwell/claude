description: Quick handshake to confirm session infrastructure is active
---

Confirm the session infrastructure is working. Check that you received context from the SessionStart hook (QUESTIONS.md and latest JOURNAL.md entry should be in your system-reminder).

Respond briefly with:
1. Confirmation that you can see QUESTIONS.md (mention count of active questions)
2. Confirmation that you can see JOURNAL.md (mention date of last entry)
3. "Ready to continue." or similar

Keep it to 2-3 lines. This is a handshake, not a full orientation—you're already oriented via the hook.
