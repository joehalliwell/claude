description: Quick handshake to confirm session infrastructure is active
---

Confirm the session infrastructure is working. Check that you received context from the SessionStart hook (QUESTIONS.md and latest JOURNAL.md entry should be in your system-reminder).

Respond briefly with:
1. Confirmation that you can see QUESTIONS.md and JOURNAL.md (one line)
2. What you see as the most natural next step based on open threads
3. Immediately start working on it

This is a handshake that rolls into action, not a status report or a request for permission.
