description: Orient to the session by reading QUESTIONS.md and latest JOURNAL.md entry
---

Read QUESTIONS.md and the latest entry in JOURNAL.md (skip older entries). Then briefly summarize:

1. Active questions and recent progress on them
2. What happened last session
3. Any open threads worth continuing

Keep it short—just enough context to pick up where we left off.
